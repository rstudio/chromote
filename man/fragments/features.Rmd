Chromote is an R implementation of the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). It works with Chrome, Chromium, Opera, Vivaldi, and other browsers based on [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/). By default it uses Google Chrome (which must already be installed on the system). To use a different browser, see `vignette("which-chrome")`.

Chromote is not the only R package that implements the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Here are some others:

* [crrri](https://github.com/RLesur/crrri) by Romain Lesur and Christophe Dervieux
* [decapitated](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/decapitated/) by Bob Rudis
* [chradle](https://github.com/milesmcbain/chradle) by Miles McBain

The interface to Chromote is similar to [chrome-remote-interface](https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface) for node.js.

## Features

* Install and use specific versions of Chrome from the [Chrome for Testing](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing) service.

* Offers a synchronous API for ease of use and an asynchronous API for more sophisticated tasks.

* Full support for the Chrome DevTools Protocol for any version of Chrome or any Chrome-based browser.

* Includes convenience methods, like `$screenshot()` and `$set_viewport_size()`, for common tasks.

* Automatically reconnects to previous sessions if the connection from R to Chrome is lost, for example when restarting from sleep state.

* Powers many higher-level packages and functions, like `{shinytest2}` and `rvest::read_html_live()`.
