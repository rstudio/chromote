Chromote is an R implementation of the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). It works with Chrome, Chromium, Opera, Vivaldi, and other browsers based on [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/). By default it uses Google Chrome (which must already be installed on the system). To use a different browser, see `vignette("which-chrome")`.

Chromote is not the only R package that implements the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Here are some others:

* [crrri](https://github.com/RLesur/crrri) by Romain Lesur and Christophe Dervieux
* [decapitated](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/decapitated/) by Bob Rudis
* [chradle](https://github.com/milesmcbain/chradle) by Miles McBain

The interface to Chromote is similar to [chrome-remote-interface](https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface) for node.js.

## Features

* Install and use specific versions of Chrome from the [Chrome for Testing](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing) service.

* Offers a synchronous API for ease of use and an asynchronous API for more sophisticated tasks.

* Full support for the Chrome DevTools Protocol for any version of Chrome or any Chrome-based browser.

* Includes convenience methods, like `$screenshot()` and `$set_viewport_size()`, for common tasks.

* Automatically reconnects to previous sessions if the connection from R to Chrome is lost, for example when restarting from sleep state.

* Powers many higher-level packages and functions, like `{shinytest2}` and `rvest::read_html_live()`.

## Installation

```R
# CRAN
install.packages("chromote")

# Development
remotes::install_github("rstudio/chromote")
```

## Basic usage

This will start a headless browser and open an interactive viewer for it in a normal browser, so that you can see what the headless browser is doing.

```R
library(chromote)

b <- ChromoteSession$new()

# In a web browser, open a viewer for the headless browser. Works best with
# Chromium-based browsers.
b$view()
```

The browser can be given _commands_, as specified by the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). For example, `$Browser$getVersion()` (which corresponds to the [Browser.getVersion](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Browser/#method-getVersion) in the API docs) will query the browser for version information:


```R
b$Browser$getVersion()
#> $protocolVersion
#> [1] "1.3"
#>
#> $product
#> [1] "HeadlessChrome/98.0.4758.102"
#>
#> $revision
#> [1] "@273bf7ac8c909cde36982d27f66f3c70846a3718"
#>
#> $userAgent
#> [1] "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) HeadlessChrome/98.0.4758.102 Safari/537.36"
#>
#> $jsVersion
#> [1] "9.8.177.11"
```


If you have the viewer open and run the following, you'll see the web page load in the viewer:

```R
b$Page$navigate("https://www.r-project.org/")
```

In the official Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) documentation, this is the [`Page.navigate`](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Page/#method-navigate) command.

In addition to full support of the CDP, `ChromoteSession` objects also some convenience methods, like `$screenshot()`. (See the Examples section below for more information about screenshots.)

```R
# Saves to screenshot.png
b$screenshot()

# Takes a screenshot of elements picked out by CSS selector
b$screenshot("sidebar.png", selector = ".sidebar")
```
