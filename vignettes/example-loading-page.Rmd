```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

``` r
library(chromote)
b <- ChromoteSession$new()
```

In many cases, the commands `Page$navigate()` and then `$Page$loadEventFired()` will not reliably block until the page loads.
For example:

``` r
# Not reliable
b$Page$navigate("https://www.r-project.org/")
b$Page$loadEventFired()  # Block until page has loaded
```

This is because the browser might successfully navigate to the page before it receives the `loadEventFired` command from R.

In order to navigate to a page reliably, you must issue the `loadEventFired` command first in async mode, then issue the `navigate` command, and then wait for the `loadEventFired` promise to resolve.
(If it has already resolved at this point, then the code will continue.)

``` r
# Reliable method 1: for use with synchronous API
p <- b$Page$loadEventFired(wait_ = FALSE)  # Get the promise for the loadEventFired
b$Page$navigate("https://www.r-project.org/", wait_ = FALSE)

# Block until p resolves
b$wait_for(p)

# Add more synchronous commands here
b$screenshot("browser.png")
```

The above code uses the async API to do the waiting, but then assumes that you want to write subsequent code with the synchronous API.

If you want to go fully async, then instead of calling `wait_for(p)`, you would simply chain more promises from `p`, using `$then()`.

``` r
# Reliable method 2: for use with asynchronous API
p <- b$Page$loadEventFired(wait_ = FALSE)  # Get the promise for the loadEventFired
b$Page$navigate("https://www.r-project.org/", wait_ = FALSE)

# Chain more async commands after the page has loaded
p$then(function(value) {
  b$screenshot("browser.png", wait_ = FALSE)
})
```

This is explained in more detail in `vignette("sync-async")`.
