For websites that require authentication, you can use Chromote to get screenshots by doing the following:

1.  Log in interactively and navigate to the page.
2.  Capture cookies from the page and save them.
3.  In a later R session, load the cookies.
4.  Use the cookies in Chromote and navigate to the page.
5.  Take a screenshot.

There are two ways to capture the cookies.

## Method 1: Manually interact with the page

The first method uses the headless browser's viewer.
This can be a bit inconvenient because it requires going through the entire login process, even if you have already logged in with a normal browser.

First navigate to the page:

``` r
library(chromote)
b <- ChromoteSession$new()
b$view()
b$Page$navigate("https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/123456/")
```

Next, log in interactively via the viewer.
Once that's done, use Chromote to capture the cookies.

``` r
cookies <- b$Network$getCookies()
str(cookies)
saveRDS(cookies, "cookies.rds")
```

After saving the cookies, you can restart R and navigate to the page, using the cookies.

``` r
library(chromote)
b <- ChromoteSession$new()
b$view()
cookies <- readRDS("cookies.rds")
b$Network$setCookies(cookies = cookies$cookies)
# Navigate to the app that requires a login
b$Page$navigate("https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/123456/")
b$screenshot()
```

## Method 2: Capture and re-use cookies

The second method captures the cookies using a normal browser.
This is can be more convenient because, if you are already logged in, you don't need to do it again.
This requires a Chromium-based browser, and it requires running DevTools-in-DevTools on that browser.

First, navigate to the page in your browser.
Then press CMD-Option-I (Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-I (Windows/Linux).
The developer tools panel will open.
Make sure to undock the developer tools so that they are in their own window.
Then press CMD-Option-I or Ctrl-Shift-I again.
A second developer tools window will open.
(See [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12291138/how-do-you-inspect-the-web-inspector-in-chrome/12291163#12291163) for detailed instructions.)

In the second developer tools window, run the following:

``` js
var cookies = await Main.sendOverProtocol('Network.getCookies', {})
JSON.stringify(cookies)
```

This will return a JSON string representing the cookies for that page.
For example:

``` json
[{"cookies":[{"name":"AWSALB","value":"T3dNdcdnMasdf/cNn0j+JHMVkZ3RI8mitnAggd9AlPsaWJdsfoaje/OowIh0qe3dDPiHc0mSafe5jNH+1Aeinfalsd30AejBZDYwE","domain":"beta.rstudioconnect.com","path":"/","expires":1594632233.96943,"size":130,"httpOnly":false,"secure":false,"session":false}]}]
```

Copy that string to the clipboard.
In your R session, you can paste it to this code, surrounded by single-quotes:

``` r
cookie_json <- '[{"cookies":[{"name":"AWSALB","value":"T3dNdcdnMasdf/cNn0j+JHMVkZ3RI8mitnAggd9AlPsaWJdsfoaje/OowIh0qe3dDPiHc0mSafe5jNH+1Aeinfalsd30AejBZDYwE","domain":"beta.rstudioconnect.com","path":"/","expires":1594632233.96943,"size":130,"httpOnly":false,"secure":false,"session":false}]}]'

cookies <- jsonlite::fromJSON(cookie_json, simplifyVector = FALSE)[[1]]
```

Then you can use Chromote to navigate to the page and take a screenshot.

``` r
library(chromote)
b <- ChromoteSession$new()

b$Network$setCookies(cookies = cookies$cookies)
b$Page$navigate("https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/123456/")

b$screenshot()
```
